# ViViT Medical Video Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the complete code for setting up, training, and evaluating the ViViT model on a selected video dataset from MedMNIST. It showcases the model's ability to process and learn from complex video data, providing an example of applying machine learning techniques in the field of medical video analysis. A pre-trained model is not used, and the training process starts from scratch.

## Key Features

- **ViViT Model Implementation:** Utilizes the ViViT architecture, a transformer-based model designed for handling video data, to perform classification tasks on medical videos.
- **MedMNIST Dataset:** Leverages the specialized datasets provided by MedMNIST, designed for biomedical image classification tasks. The MedMNIST dataset is diverse, encompassing various types of medical images, including but not limited to organ images, dermoscopic images, and blood cell microscopy images. It offers a comprehensive platform for medical image classification with multiple classes, each representing a distinct medical condition or type. MedMNIST v2 enhances this benchmark by offering a large-scale, lightweight dataset for both 2D and 3D biomedical image classification, making it more versatile and applicable to a wider range of medical imaging tasks.
